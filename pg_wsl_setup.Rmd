# Set up Postgres

`wsl` installed.  Installed `windows terminal preview (wtp)`

Open Ubuntu window in `wtp` and navigate to `cd ~` to get into the home directory


Installed a `postgresql 13` as per https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-install-postgresql-13-on-ubuntu/

<br>


Only real mod to this was that I needed to assign a password `sudo passwd postgres` as per https://karansingh1559.medium.com/how-to-set-up-postgresql-on-ubuntu-for-wsl-fcbb777d165b 

`sudo su - postgres`

`psql -c "alter user postgres with password 'postgres'"`

If kyou are re-entering a linux shell then you need to restart the service

`sudo service postgresql start`

<br>

I changed the port to 5434 as I already have postgres on 5432 in my normal windows OS so I will leave there. I changed it as per 
https://karansingh1559.medium.com/how-to-set-up-postgresql-on-ubuntu-for-wsl-fcbb777d165b with 

`sudo vi /etc/postgresql/13/main/postgresql.conf`.

`sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql stop`
`sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql start`
`sudo service postgresql restart` ???

`sudo vi /etc/postgresql/13/main/postgresql.conf`
listen_addresses = '*'                  # what IP address(es) to listen on;

add postgis https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-install-postgis-on-ubuntu-debian/

`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`
`sudo apt update`
`sudo apt install postgis postgresql-13-postgis-3`

 DO NOT CHANGE PERMISSIONS WILLY NILLY - it will wreck the OS see https://serverfault.com/questions/364677/why-is-chmod-r-777-destructive 
`sudo chmod -R a+rwx /etc/postgresql/13/main/pg_hba.conf`
`sudo chmod -R a+rwx /etc/postgresql/13/main/postgresql.conf`
`sudo chmod -R a+rwx .profile`

`psql -d postgis`




`CREATE EXTENSION postgis;`
`create extension ltree;`


verify:

`SELECT PostGIS_version();`

success

`sudo -i -u postgres`

Seems to be working.

How to Terminate running distro
https://winaero.com/terminate-running-wsl-linux-distro-windows-10/
in command prompt `wsl --terminate Ubuntu-20.04`


This has useful info on seeing where your wsl ip is at
https://serverfault.com/questions/1041981/how-can-i-connect-to-postgres-running-on-the-windows-host-from-inside-wsl2

`sudo apt install net-tools`
`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`
`ifconfig`
`cat /etc/resolv.conf`

Lets try to run bcdata and set up env variables

`(base) newgraph@MSI:~$ bcdata list | grep AIRPORTS
WHSE_IMAGERY_AND_BASE_MAPS.GSR_AIRPORTS_SVW`

works

`bcdata bc2pg bc-airports --db_url postgresql://newgraph:postgres@localhost:5434/postgis`



## from simon
I think the key here is creating the new db user. Don't use the default postgres user. I think postgres prompts you for a pwd when you do createuser -P -s -e mynewuser.


what a BOSS!


problem with permissions https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/127857-access-wsl-linux-files-windows-10-a.html 

files are at `\\wsl\Ubuntu-20.04`
 
`/mnt/c` is path of your C drive


##couldn't automate this.  not sure why.  needed to load each setting manully
run the setup for our postgres settings 

`cd /scripts/setups/setup_default_database.sh`


`bcdata bc2pg bc-airports`    

WORKS!!!

note that I did not run the following and it is working

see comments at https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/pg_wsl/issues/1 and https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/auth-pg-hba-conf.html

echo "host all all 0.0.0.0/0 md5" >> $PGDATA/pg_hba.conf
echo "listen_addresses = '*'" >> /etc/postgresql/13/main/postgresql.conf
